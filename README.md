# Path Finder Visualizer AI Project

This is a path finder visualizer AI project implemented in Java, leveraging the A* search algorithm. The project includes a user interface (UI) built with JavaSwing, allowing users to interact with the visualization and observe the path finding process in action.

## Technologies Used

- Java
- JavaSwing

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your Java IDE.
3. Run the `Main.java` file.
4. Use the UI to select a start and end point, place obstacles, and run the path finding algorithm.
5. Observe the path finding algorithm in action, visualized in real time.

## A* Search Algorithm

The A* search algorithm is a widely used path finding algorithm that uses a heuristic function to estimate the cost of the cheapest path from the start node to the goal node. The algorithm keeps track of the cost of reaching each node and the estimated total cost of getting from the start node to the goal node via that node.

## UI Features

- Select a start and end point.
- Place obstacles that the path finder must navigate around.
- Randomize the board's obsticles and goal location
- Clear the board and start over.
